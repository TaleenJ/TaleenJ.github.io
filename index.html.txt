### CPSC 120

Lab 8

I really liked Lab 8 because we were able to convert the square root formula into code. 
It took a while but it was really cool once it was done. After this lab I think I can 
convert any math formula and turn it into a function.

Lab 2

My second favorite Lab was number two because it was the first time I used strings. 
Although there were many lines to print out, the final result was cool. After this 
lab I was feeling confident about using the cout statement and cin.

Lab 5

My third favorite lab was Lab 5 because It was cool calling different functions to 
make black jack. It was really frustrating to work it out but I really liked the end 
result. As usual after this I felt like a pro, after making black jack what can stop me.
